# pr-peddler

> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) to provide metadata about pull requests.

## Setup
```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot
npm start
```

## Deployment
Add a webhook for a Slack channel using [these instructions](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks#:~:text=2.,toggle%20to%20switch%20it%20on.)
<br> Grab the rest of the needed environment variables from the GitHub App created by Probot
<br> The app may be deployed by any server that can run NodeJS, so Heroku would be fine.
<br> I went with [Glitch](https://www.glitch.com) and the deployment steps may be found [here](https://probot.github.io/docs/deployment/#deploy-the-app)
